    "Q1.  What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database.\n",
    " \n",
    " SQL:- It is also known as relational database management system(RDBMS).\n",
    "       These databases have fixed or static or predefined schema\n",
    "       These databases are not suited for hierarchical data storage.\n",
    "       These databases are best suited for complex queries.\n",
    "       It is vertically scalable.\n",
    "       Follows ACID property.\n",
    "       Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS-SQL Server, etc\n",
    "       \n",
    " NoSQL:-Non-relational or distributed database system.\n",
    "        They have dynamic schema\n",
    "         These databases are best suited for hierarchical data storage.\n",
    "         These databases are not so good for complex queries.\n",
    "         Horizontally scalable.\n",
    "        Follows CAP(consistency, availability, partition tolerance)\n",
    "        Examples: MongoDB, GraphQL, HBase, Neo4j, Cassandra, etc\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:- Data Definition Language(DDL) is a subset of SQL and a part of DBMS(Database Management System). \n",
    "      DDL consist of Commands to commands like CREATE, ALTER, TRUNCATE and DROP. \n",
    "      These commands are used to create or modify the tables in SQL.\n",
    "      \n",
    "1. CREATE :-This command is used to create a new table in SQL. The user has to give information like table name, column names, and their datatypes.\n",
